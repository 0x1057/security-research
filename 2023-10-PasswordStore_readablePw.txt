VULNERABILITY

s_password - while marked private - is not hidden from view.  It is a state variable and thus stored on chain.
Anytime a password is set it is stored in s_password. 

IMPACT

Anyone can read the password by viewing storage slots. The attempt in getPassword() to implement some access
control falls short due to this.

TOOLS USED

Manual review performed in GitHub and VS Code

RECOMMENDATIONS

NEVER store sensitive data on chain!  There is no need to do this.
