2023-10-PasswordStore

VULNERABILITY

There is no check on who can set the password in this contract. This makes the whole thing useless as any
password can be set and set again arbitrarily by any user attempting to do so.  

IMPACT

Since anyone can call setPassword(), valid passwords can be overwritten by anyone

TOOLS USED

Manual review performed in GitHub and VS Code

RECOMMENDATIONS

Utilize the PasswordStore_NotOwner error at the top of the contract in the same fashion it is utilized in the
getPassword() function
